  <p>If you throw open a map of the middle part of America and lay your eyes
upon the Mississippi, this enormous, 5,000-kilometer-long river, what
you’ll see is somewhat muddled and full of bends—but nevertheless, on
the whole, you’ll note a sharp line running pretty clearly from north to
south. To such a line, a person could believe, one might entrust oneself
just as surely as to any highway or railway line. The people living upon
the banks of this river, however—farmers, fishermen, even the
city-folk—know that this appearance is deceptive. The Mississippi is in
constant motion, not only its masses of water, which it moves from
source to river mouth, but just as much its banks, which are continually
shifting.</p>
<p>Countless lakes, lagoons, swamps, und ditches lie at a distance of ten
to fifty miles from the present river and show, by their very
composition, that they are none other than segments of the former
riverbed, which has in the meantime shifted westward or eastward. So
long as the river flows through solid stone, roughly down to the
southern tip of the state of Illinois, its course is fairly straight.
Later, however, it crosses over to the bottom land and, in this soft
earth, its untrustworthiness and restlessness show themselves. Never
does the bed it itself dug suit the river. And that’s not all: in
spring, the swollen tributaries of the Mississippi—the Arkansas, the Red
River, the Ouachita River—fall with their masses of water upon the
flanks of the filled-to- brimming Mississippi and not only crowd into
the principal current with their own water, but construct a barrier, so
to speak, bottling up the water of the Mississippi and contributing as
well to the flooding of its banks. So it was that, for hundreds of
years, all the land for hundreds of miles was flooded every year. The
plantations, fields, settlements, virgin forests, and gardens stood
under meters of water and the surroundings of the river resembled an
ocean, the treetops its islands.</p>
<p>At the outset of the last century, people began the task of securing
individual stretches of the banks against the annually changing moods of
the river. Back then, embankments were raised at the expense of the
affected river-bank owners in many places, which naturally protected the
land lying below them, but did so only at the expense of neighbors who
suffered only the more for these dams. Gradually, the majority of the
lower-lying plantations protected themselves in this manner. And to
lighten the financial burden on the planters, the American Congress gave
to them all the marshland lying behind their settlements as
compensation. Now, you can all imagine what it must have meant for these
planters, who possessed nothing but their land, when one day they were
ordered to tear down the dams with their own hands and open their
settlements to the destructive violence of the water. That really did
once happen, however, and with that, I arrive at the most shocking and
bleakest episode of the great flood of 1927.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the Mississippi, as perhaps you know, lies the great,
important trade-city of New Orleans. In less than two weeks, the water
had risen so high that this decisive port at the mouth of the
Mississippi seemed bound for destruction. If New Orleans was to be
saved, the people had to grasp at a final, desperate measure: the
protective embankments upriver from the city had to be blown up, giving
the water access to the fields. This was the signal for a bitter civil
war, which only multiplied the horrors of the natural catastrophe. The
farmers whose lands were to be sacrificed to save the metropolis were
among the poorest in the land. Under the direction of one of the many
American sect leaders, they formed up into armed troops, meaning to
prevent the dams from being blown up. Thousands of farmers were decided:
better to fight than to purchase the rescue of the city with the ruin of
their fields. The government grasped at straws, naming a general
administrator of the floodplain; a state of siege had to be imposed. For
their part, the formers armed themselves with machine-guns in order to
make a stand against the military. Against the current President of the
United States, Hoover, who at that time appeared in the flood-zone as
Secretary of State, an assassination was attempted. But the government
was not to be intimidated; the detonations went forward. New Orleans was
saved, but one hundred thousand square miles stood underwater; the
number of the homeless in those areas amounted to half a million.</p>
<p>The flood walls of the Mississippi that were dynamited then—those that
the river had not burst through already—belong to the largest
governmental undertaking in America. For 2,500 kilometers, these
constructed embankments stretch along both sides of the river, down to
the Gulf of Mexico. Not infrequently, they measure ten meters high by
fifty meters wide. Untold thousands of workers must build new dams year
by year and keep the old in good repair. An electronic warning system
connects all the stations with one another. Every week, the dams are
tested and many millions are spent on them every year. So it was that,
for more than ten years, they served to keep nearby residents perfectly
at ease—until the high waters of the spring of 1927 fell upon them.</p>
<p>On the 16th of April, the telegraph announced for the first time that
the river had risen above the riverbanks. These first reports, however,
seemed quite innocent, and in Washington they hoped the river would have
its fill with smaller disruptions. This, however, proved a mistake. Two
days later, already seven states were in parts completely flooded. Great
swathes of Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Texas
lay underwater. The deluge reached to seven or eight meters above the
fields. Dozens of cities, hundreds of townships had to be evacuated, and
woe to those who were tardy or slow to decide about it. For instance, we
know the story of three brothers, small farmers from the vicinity of
Natchez. They believed they could still take the time to save their
livestock. While others abandoned everything in the effort to save their
bare lives, the three busied themselves in the stables and—before they
knew it—their way was blocked by a powerful tongue of water. They were
trapped and remained so. Only one of the three came away with his life,
and from him, we have the nightmarish account of the hours that they
spent on the crown of their roof, staring into the ever-rising
floodwaters with ever-sinking hopes. Listen, now, to a piece of the
survivor’s story:</p>
<p>“The water left us but a narrow strip of the roof ridge free. The one
chimney had already been torn away. Nothing more could be seen of the
ravaged settlement around us. Only from the church tower, which towered
unbroken against the heavens, the voices of the saved rang out toward
us. In the distance, we heard the water rushing. No longer did we hear
houses collapsing. It was like a shipwreck in the middle of the ocean,
thousands of miles away from shore.</p>
<p>‘We’ll be carried away,’ muttered John, who was clutching desperately at
the bricks. It really felt as if the roof had metamorphosed into a raft
and was being carried away by the current. But when we looked at the
church tower, which stood there unmoving, we saw that it had been an
illusion. We were, just as ever, on that same speck in the midst of the
churning waves. —Now, however, the battle was joined. At first, the
river had flowed along the street, but now the rubble barred its way and
drove it back. It was a full-fledged onslaught. The river grabbed onto
each timber or tree trunk within its reach and hurled it like a missile
against the house. And even then the river did not let go its
projectile, but grasped it closely in order to hurl it out again. The
walls trembled beneath these unremitting, steady blows. It was not long
before we were bombarded with ten or twelve timbers in this fashion. The
roiling masses of water clamored and bellowed, and the foam licked at
our feet. From the house below us, there sounded out a dull groan, and
we heard it cracking at the joints. Sometimes, when once more a beam was
dashed against the walls with terrible force, we thought it was
over—they would give way and deliver us up to the savage river. Other
times, when we saw a bale of hay or an empty barrel drifting toward us,
we joyfully waved a kerchief—until we apprehended our error and sank
back into mute anguish.</p>
<p>‘Ah, do you see there,’ John cried suddenly, ‘an enormous boat!’ With
outstretched arm, he gestured toward a dark point in the distance. I
could make out nothing, Bill just as little, but he stood fast. And it
was indeed a boat. The oar-strokes came ever closer, until we too
finally spotted it. It glided slowly forwards, seeming to circle
us—without, however, coming nearer. Anymore, I only know that in that
moment we were as if mad. We raised our arms and cried full-throatedly.
We hurled curses against the boat and held it a coward as it glided on,
mute and black. Was it really a boat? —I don’t know, still today. As we
watched it finally disappear, it took our last hopes with it. —From then
on, we expected at every instant that the house would collapse and
devour us.</p>
<p>It had to be fully undermined already; some exceptionally strong wall
seemed to be holding the whole thing up, but when it fell apart, it
would tear everything down along with it. I shuddered above all at the
thought that the roof would bear our weight no longer. The house could
perhaps withstand the whole night, but the roof began to give way under
the ongoing impact of the timbers. We had fled to the left side, where
the rafters were still fairly undamaged. But then they began to sway
here, too—it was to be expected that they would not hold much longer if
all three of us remained huddled together in the same spot. —My brother
Bill had, quite mechanically, stuck his pipe in his mouth again. He
twirled at his moustache, furrowed his brows, and grumbled to himself.
The increasing danger he saw before his eyes, against which all his
courage was as naught, began to make him impatient. With wrathful
disdain, he spat a couple times into the water. Then, with the beams
giving way beneath him ever the more, he arrived at a decision and
descended from the crown of the roof.</p>
<p>&#39;Bill, Bill,&#39; I cried. With complete horror, I guessed at what he
intended. He turned around and said quietly, &#39;Goodbye, Louis . . . you
know, it’s taking too long for me. I want to make room for you.&#39;</p>
<p>Then he first threw his pipe away and afterward himself sprang into the
flood. &#39;Goodbye,&#39; he said once more, &#39;I’ve had enough of this.&#39; He did
not emerge again. He was a poor swimmer, and probably did not even try
to save himself. He did not wish to survive our ruin and the death of
our loved ones.” —So much for the story of the third brother, the only
one from this family to be recovered by one of the boats that searched
the water.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 ships, motorboats, and steamers were mobilized. Even
luxury yachts were seized by the government for use in the rescue
effort. Whole squadrons of aircraft were in the air day and night, just
as, in years past, the starving Chinese in the river valley of the
Yangtze Kiang, entirely cut off from every form of transportation, had
been brought foodstuffs and medical supplies by planes under the command
of Charles Lindbergh. At this point, too, hundreds of thousands of
refugees camped out under the open sky along the Mississippi —with no
roof over their heads, no warm clothing, abandoned to hunger, rain, and
the terrible hurricanes that laid waste to the flooded area around this
time.</p>
<p>So much too, then, for the unfettered elements of the Mississippi.
Another time, however, we’ll want to look back to its banks, which even
during the periods where the river drifted peacefully in its bed were by
no means always peaceful. For some time now, I’ve been meaning to tell
you all the story of America’s largest and most dangerous secret
society, compared to which all the packs of whiskey smugglers and all
the criminal gangs of Chicago are kid stuff: the story of the Ku Klux
Klan. At that point, we’ll find ourselves again on the banks of the
Mississippi, but then we’ll be facing the unchained elements of human
cruelty and violence. And the dams built against these elements by the
law bore up no better than the actual ones of earth and stone. Regarding
all that, then—the Ku Klux Klan and Judge Lynch and the other sinister
figures who have peopled or people still the human wilderness of the
Mississippi—another time.</p>
